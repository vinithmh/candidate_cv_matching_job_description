Experience
01/2003 to Current
VP, Principal Company Name ï¼​ City , State
Architected and developed an innovative product called ""IBOR 1.0"" to provide real-time market values,exposures and related analytics
using operational data store(ODS). This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g.
pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at
Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.
Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment
for a mission critical product.
Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took
ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for
more than 10 years in a row.
Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I
was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate
new quality products as well as support existing products in production.
Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-
memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at
Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production
since 2013.
Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions
in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.
Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform.
IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure
information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data
and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and
analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud
environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.
My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect
on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly
available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and
investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due
to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from
monolithic architecture to service based architecture.
Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The
ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle to
Amazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.
Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment
decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning
complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.
Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process
to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data
lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications

Maintained positive work atmosphere by building relationships with co-workers, customers, clients and management.
PROJECTS Question Answering System: As the sole resource on this project created a windows application with Phyton for COVID-19
related questions using BERT and ELMO language models.
The Frameworks were Pandas, Tensorflow, NLTK.
Data Visualization Tool: The objective of this project was to analyze communication structures, employee relationships and suspicious
transactions by designing and implementing a data visualization tool.
The dataset included the VAST Challenge 2019 dataset with over 100,000+ data.
The Frameworks were Flask, Pandas and the Language was Phyton.
My responsibilities were data cleansing and data categorization.
From the data visualization Leadership was able to get insight in the growth, sales, costs and make decisions towards better performance.
Pre-Assess Melanoma: The objective of the project was to create a system that could pre-assess malignant melanoma using Matlab
Language and image processing algorithms.
The system was trained with the images of malignant and healthy images.
My responsibilities included all development, testing and training.
The User Interface was the responsibility of other team member.
This system enabled the users to seek healthcare at earlier stages of melanoma.
