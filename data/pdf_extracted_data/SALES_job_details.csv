Professional Affiliations
1993-2007-In past experience I have had 10 years of combined skill as a commercial truck driver, with everything from local route work as a
sanitation engineer, to construction material delivery, to long haul OTR driver.Â 
1994-2004-As well as the above listed, I have had ten years as a Paid Call Firefighter (PCF) for Madera County.Â In this function one of the
many things I learned was the duties of radio dispatch protocol.Â 
Accomplishments
Was instrumental in instituting a new scheduling practice that streamlined our booking process.Â  Results of the new scheduling procedure
increased our booking appointments from only booking 1 month out, to booking every 4 to 6 weeks for up to 1 to 2 years out. Â I developed a
new advanced payment option, where the clients can pre-pay onto a debit style card. They can choose the set amount of funds. With this option
they get a percentage discount taken off for booking the year. With these cards they can reload anytime, and with this creative plan it drastically
increased the predictability of the income variables. Â Â
