Experience

Information Technology Analyst Company Name
I believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning.
Designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on
their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially,
emotionally, physically, and intellectually.
I believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with
tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum.
Letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them.
My personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets.
Students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the
direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity.
I would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each child's needs and interests.
Curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and
themselves.
Motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child.
Recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the
children.
Giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a
great feeling.
Giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child.
Developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions.
Make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable.
Giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend
more time in school than any other place.
I believe in the quote 'A strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong', I would encourage more of the outdoor
activities during the supporting weather.
I feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in
outdoor group activities.
A healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy
foods, and less sodium and sugar.
I would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher.
I understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of
cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children.
Enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school
leaving the parents.
My philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place.

This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.
I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a
Service (SaaS) product.
I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed
the idea that they should move from ""selling"" software to ""renting"" it via an up and coming model SaaS.
Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an
exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring
revenue.
I was hired in 05' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies
and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.
As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.
Again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of
leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.
I'm very proud of the work I've done and Adsystech, below are some key areas in my control: Network Design Monitoring and
Maintenance Cloud Technologies Cyber Security (NITS, CIS, HITRUST/HIPAA) Project Management Technical Support Management
Staff Professional Development RFP Responses.
Information technology Manager Sep 2003 to Sep 2005 
Company Name ï¼​ City , State
City organization responsible for managing +120 Million dollars for support of County Wide Human Service programs.
I was hired as Project Manager and was quickly promoted to the Information Technology Manger.
As PM I identified, evaluated and lead a bi-County steering committee in all technical aspect in an RFP release and selection process.
After promotion I continued to server as the project manager for the 2.5 million dollar system rollout which ranged from gathering the
business requirements for the design and deployment to creating the processes and managing the team to for the roll out to ~2000 users
across Los Angeles County.
In this capacity I managed a project support team including administrators, help desk staff and trainers.
As the IT Manager, I supervised network administrators and was responsible for all high level network design and architecture for the
organization.
I evaluated the security risks, ensuring HITECH/HIPAA protocol were followed.
Below are some key areas in my control: Network Design and Oversight Project Management Product Training and Support.
Information technology Manager Sep 1998 to Mar 2003 
Company Name ï¼​ City , State
At Relax the Back I was responsible for the overall management, infrastructure and strategic planning of our National point of sale network
at 100+ retail locations and 5 distribution centers.
I managed the ERP solution at our manufacturing plant in Boston and our accounting and HR systems at the corporate office.
Nine short months after starting with the company, I was promoted to IT Manage.

Jose Miguel Morales - VP Security Engineering January 24, 2003 To Whom It May Concern, The intent of this letter is to express my
professional regards for Mr.
William Hale.
I have known Mr.
Hale for over a year in academic milieu.
During this period I have had the pleasure of being associated with one of the finest people that anyone could ever come in contact with.
William's technical and professional prowess has accorded him the highest regards from his peers.
He has a thorough understanding of the job requirements and how to accomplish corporate goals without sacrificing individual creativity.
William is not only a success in his career, but is always interested in the betterment of his fellow man.
I have observed him many times in the process of accomplishing things that truly are representative of a person with a strong family and
moral convictions.
William is a man that can wear many hats, and his humbleness allows him to be a good server, and at times adapt to the position of a leader.
I am deeply impressed by Mr.

I am confident that, if selected for your vacancy, he would provide the same high level of service and commitment.
Sincerely Yours, Jose' M.

Company Name City , State Information Technology 02/2011 to Current
I was hired to manage accreditation efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3 accreditation packages each leading to
successful Authorization To Operate decisions. Responsibilities then increased to include all departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3
successful ATOs. Now, working on 4 new accreditation including re-authorization for an existing project. Succeeded in writing and implementing
vulnerability management for existing accredited systems. Success of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in critical design
decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise business model to understand
the best fit for the program. The different projects required careful management of specific STIG compliance and hardening for the different
configurations and services required for the specific domain to be integrated.Â Â  Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and
risk.Â Â  Supervised 5 external computer consultants and vendors.Â Â  Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and
network configuration.
Company Name City , State Systems Engineer 02/2006 to 02/2011
I was Hired to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements. Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product
problems and strengths and collected data on customer experienceÂ  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new technology for
supporting new processing needs thru proper processing power.Â  The next challengeÂ  came as storage requirements for better performance and
more controlled uses. After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local
storage to over 200TB. In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the
alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed,
purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.Â  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30
minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.
Company Name City , State Senior Systems Analyst 02/1999 to 02/2006
I was hired to improve corporate and client communications and processing requirements which resulted in the design, build and deployment of 3
Enterprise network solutions. One solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii
support facilities. Fulfilled requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and
solutions for avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru documenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to
understand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management.
