Driving Change, DDI, Ports America So Cal regional Office, 2013.
This course helps leaders implement change in the workplace so they can avoid the problems that plague 70% of failed change initiatives.
Driving Change provides the skills and resources leaders need to accelerate the process of implementing change with their team members
and to create an agile work environment where people are more open to change.

This course introduces leaders to the essential interaction skills that are critical to leadership success.
These Interaction Essentials are the core behaviors that leaders need to be effective in the many situations they handle on a daily basis, such
as coaching, delegating, and driving change.
Leaders learn how to meet the personal and practical needs of their team members and how to communicate to spark action in others to
achieve business results.
The goal is that leaders learn how to provide positive feedback that recognizes and motivates individuals and teams as well as
developmental feedback that helps others get back on track.

Helps front line managers to reasonably suspect an employee of being under the influence.
Volunteer Orange County Makos, Defensive Coordinator, Fullerton, CA The opportunity to coach opened up my eyes to the benefits of
encouragement and leading thru adversity.
The team was wrought with internal struggles because of the lack of trust in team ownership.
As the Defensive Coordinator, I was challenged to convince the defensive players to trust the work ethic of the offensive players and to
verbally encourage their play.
In 2001, we had a head coach and ownership change and with 95% of the previous team returning, we reshaped expectations and built
confidence thru competition.
We finished the year as CFL Champions.
AYSO, Coach, Long Beach, CA Coaching young children has helped me to simplify instructions, gauge motivation in each child and tailor
my approach to build their confidence.
These key points, I learned coaching young and older athletes crosses over to employees.
People need consistent and helpful direction to improve their performance and ability to hone their craft.
Athletes and employees look to their coach or boss for leadership and motivation to help them reach their full potential.
