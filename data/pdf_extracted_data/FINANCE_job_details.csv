suited our needs; working with our new caging partner and our technology area to implement a check processing application across our
network in an effort to create a more efficient work flow.
Risk Management - working with the risk manager, we streamlined our allocation process through the creation of an insurance portal. This
application created a clearer view of what each department head was incurring in each segment of insurance. We also were successful for in
aligning our insurance policies on our fiscal year cycle.
