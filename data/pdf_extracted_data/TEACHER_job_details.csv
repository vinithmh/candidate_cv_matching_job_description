Other Accomplishments
Last year I was asked to administer the GATE after school program. Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper.
We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could
follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article
for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper
template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish
four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school
newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced
brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.","California Baptist University 2006 Bachelor of Arts : Liberal Arts City , State , United States
