Learning This was a charity event that was meant to get the students more involved with their school and give them a chance to give back to
their community. The event benefitted the National Food Bank. All of the Citrus that was picked was donated to the Food Bank to help
feed those who are less fortunate. 03/02/2011 & 11/09/10 Poverty 101/ Hunger Banquet Chandler-Gilbert Community College Pecos
Campus Department of Service Learning The Poverty 101 event benefitted me, the CGCC staff, and the students who attended the event.
By donating my time and energy to help host the event, I was able to become more intuitive of my surroundings, and help create a more
beneficial experience for my college peers. 2015-present Volunteer for Camp Kesem I was introduced to Camp Kesem through a very
close friend of mine, which allowed me the opportunity to connect with others that have been affected by cancer. This summer I'll be work
close with young children that are either battling cancer or have parents that have been affected by it, in hopes to bring some form of joy and
relief to their lives.
