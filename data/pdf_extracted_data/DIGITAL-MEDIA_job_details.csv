Accomplishments
As part of one of my last core Communications classes at The University of Louisiana at Lafayette, better known as Campaigns 490, students
were divided into 5 teams of 5 to create a campaign for a specific client, the ULL Communication Department. The proposal was to increase
recruitment numbers by 20% in the next year. Each member of the team had a unique job and mine was Editor, which entailed reviewing,
proofreading, and finalizing the group's final written reports and social media sites. After a semester of gathering and analyzing research, developing
a campaign based on objectives, creating a new branded image and evaluating the plan for the department, the Department of Communication
chose our campaign as the winning group proposal
