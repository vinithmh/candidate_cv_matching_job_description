attending Brush High School (My high School) I also attended Beechwood High School from my Junior year (11th Grade) to my senior Year
(12th Grade) to study culinary arts where we learned the basics of cooking. I was interested in how to become a cook and how to make various
dishes so I would e able to cook meals for my family at home. During high school, although I was in the Culinary Arts program, at the time it did
not keep my interest, so when I graduated I got into the Business management field, while attending college I began working as a dishwasher at
Houlihans and was intrigued again by working in the kitchen, so much that I was able to be promoted to prep cook and from there I started my
Culinary Career. Each year they have it here in Cleveland, and if I am Available, I work at our annual Air show as a cook vendor if there is an
opportunity for me. I also like to volunteer to cook for the homeless at our Cleveland Food Bank, during the holidays which I have not been able
to do recently, but I do love being able to put smiles on everyone during the holidays with exceptional and delightful meals.

Fire Science/Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Miramar Community College ï¼​ City , State , USA Living in a rural community, residents
were dependent on our volunteer fire department for all medical and fire emergencies until other paid departments could arrive. After watching my
grandmother pass away because no one in our family was capable of providing CPR, I realized I needed to step up and joined our local Volunteer
Fire Department. I completed EMT training at Miramar College, and then a 12-week National Fire Academy, where I was one of only 4 women
to pass. Â It was truly the most physically challenging endeavor I've ever completed, but certainly one I am incredibly proud of! Â I served as a
volunteer Firefighter/EMT on the San Diego Rural Fire Department for 4 years.

Was presented with Pampered Chef's Hospitality Award for graciously welcoming local consultants (whose immediate upline live out of
state) to join us at our teams' training events.
At 16, I auditioned and was selected to tour the United States with a National Dance Academy; performing for, and teaching dance to
thousands of dancers in 33 cities nationwide. Â 4,000 auditioned. 35 were selected. Â I executed my own fundraising activities and solicited
local organizations to raise the required $5,000 for travel and housing expenses.
At 18, I launched my own dance & tumbling school. I operated this successful business for 10 years, when I chose to ""sell"" my clientele to
another local dance studio.
At 19, I completed, and graduated from, the National Fire Academy in San Diego, CA.
Was 1 of 7 to be awarded my high school's ""Valiant V"". Selected by the school staff, this award recognizes above-and-beyond
participation and service to both the high school and community.

Summary
My name is Evan Elias, I have recently made the important decision about my career. Computers are going fast and the world of computers is
expanding to all the corners of the earth. I want to be part of this ever-evolving staple of humanity. I also want to be able to cook and provide for
people who cannot do it themselves and be a contributor to technology in my course of life. I have taken many classes on programming and taught
myself about the IT aspect of computers. I am very strong in math and I like to solve problems. I have taken many cooking classes and have
worked in every position in a kitchen.
Highlights
I am very good under pressure from the experiences in the restaurant industry. I am very good with
Technology whether it be solving a simple internet bug or it being a big list of coding.
